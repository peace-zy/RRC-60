# RRC-60
This repository is created to publish the <i>Roman Republican Coins</i> - 60 (RRC-60) dataset and experimental settings that we followed in our paper <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167865519303708"> Sinem Aslan, Sebastiano Vascon, and Marcello Pelillo. "Two Sides of the Same Coin: Improved Ancient Coin Classification Using Graph Transduction Games." Pattern Recognition Letters (2019) </a>

In the creation of this dataset we referred to a previous public dataset of [2] with 180 images of reverse (motif) sides of 60 coin types from Roman Republican period which we also experimented on at [1]. Thus, abiding by the same coin types with [2] we created a new dataset with larger quantity and diversity, i.e. we collected 100 images for each side of the 60 coin types, which in the end resulted with 6000 image pairs for each coin specimen. 

Images are collected from <a href = 'https://www.acsearch.info/'> acsearch.info </a> and <a href = 'http://numismatics.org/crro/'> Coinage of the Roman Republic Online (CRRO) </a>

Dataset images (around 4GB) can be reached from https://drive.google.com/file/d/16EpvOJQe0Z-Zbv0SD_4igc_nY94WcaTj/view?usp=sharing
